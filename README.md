# Data-visualisation

This project is a demonstration of sentiment analysis using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The code displays a chart that represents the sentiment of different topics. The sentiment of each topic represented by how many people used that topic and what sentiment classification they were classfied

The data for sentiment analysis is obtained from a CSV file using the Papa Parse library. The code then calculates the sentiment score for each topic, and displays the scores as a chart using the Chart.js library.

The chart is interactive, allowing the user to hover over each topic to view its sentiment score. The chart also includes a legend that shows the sentiment range for each color. The code uses HTML and CSS to style the chart and make it visually appealing.

This project is intended as a proof-of-concept for interactive data visualisation. The code can be customized and extended to analyze sentiment for different datasets and topics.
